The other day I was generally tidying the various document, images and scripts that seem to slowly become scattered about my home directory and noticed something strange had happened, the MATE Places menu now had a bookmarks submenu?

I thought I had broken something after my attempts to change the icons in that menu earlier the same day, turns out it's way simpler than that! All that's happening is that if you have more than 8 bookmarks MATE will show them under a Bookmarks submenu.

So for once I hadn't broken anything, this was actually a feature. I thought I would share this as I couldn't find any mention of this when I was trying to find out what was going on.
