# Cooling Rack Foot

#3D model


This is a foot for a heavy-duty metal cooling rack.

If using soft enough plastic, you can press fit them. If you're using something more brittle like PLA then warm them
first so they are a bit pliable.

I also suggest gluing small pieces of felt to the bottom of each one.
