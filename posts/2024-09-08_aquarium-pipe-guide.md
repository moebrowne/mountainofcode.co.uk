The canister filter I bought for my aquarium came with plastic U-bends which directed the flow over the lip of the
glass. Whoever designed it obviously knew very little about fluid dynamics. It constricted flow and had hard 90&deg;
corners.

Having the tube bend smoothly without kinking required a little guide. A 20 mm vinyl tube should push snugly into this
guide.

The OpenSCAD file can be adjusted for other sized tubes, different radius bends and any angle.
