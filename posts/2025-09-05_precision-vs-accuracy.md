# Precision vs Accuracy - In Short

#in short

Accuracy is a measure of how much detail there is, precision is a measure of how close to the truth something is.

For example, take: `1 + 1 = 271.48357055`, this answer contains a lot of detail and is therefore precise. It is also far
from the truth, making it inaccurate. Another example might be `Ï€ = 3.141`, this is accurate but not very precise, or
`2690/400 = 6.725` this is both accurate and precise.

In the case of numeric values, you can argue that it's possible to always add more precision by adding zeros: 2.0 is
less precise than 2.00, which is less precise than 2.000, so on and so forth...

This applies in non-numeric situations too.

If someone can shoot a target and hit the same point every time, that is precise, but if the shot doesn't land where
they are aiming for, then it is inaccurate.
