# Badge Holder

#3D model

Lanyard style badge holder. Takes a standard credit-card-sized badge.

It is based on [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2810500). The changes I made improve ruggedness by
re-enforcing the clip-hole and increasing the overall thickness. I also adjusted the hexagon design because I didn't
like how the hexagons were aligned.

It requires supports to print, a single wall to support the edge of the overhang is enough. In Cura that requires these
settings:

- Support Pattern: Grid
- Support Density: 0%
- Support X/Y Distance: 2.5mm
- Enable Support Interface: No
