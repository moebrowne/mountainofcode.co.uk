I have what some people would refer to as a high-tech aquarium. There are a large number of plants, and those plants
need lots of CO<sub>2</sub> to grow, typically it is injected from a canister of some kind. The one I have is the 'FZONE
2.5L Aquarium CO2 Generator'.

It came with a little gas solenoid, but it would regularly get stuck and was almost too hot to touch while it was on. I
looked at getting a different solenoid, but I thought I could do better.

I had a couple of servos kicking around and thought that I could use those to control the flow using the flow valve on
the regulator instead. This meant I could adjust the flow digitally rather than trying to judge 'bubbles-per-second'.

The throw of a standard 9 g servo is just enough to adjust the flow from completely off to way-too-much.
