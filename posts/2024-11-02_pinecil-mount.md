# Pinecil Helping Hand Mount

#3D model

I bought a [Pinecil](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/) after becoming increasingly
frustrated with my ageing soldering iron.

I needed somewhere heatproof to rest it, I used the one for my old iron for a while, but it was ugly and took up a lot
of precious space on my desk. I wanted something small and that matched the elegance of the Pinecil.

I found [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5549440) and created an adaptor which fits into the third socket on my
helping hands.
