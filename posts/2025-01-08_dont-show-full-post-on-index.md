# Don't Show The Full Text On An Index Page!

#rant

When I find a new blog I will scroll through the previous posts to see if they write about the kinds of things that
interests me, so I know whether to subscribe or not, however a not-insignificant number of the sites show the full text
of posts on the index page, this makes it really hard to get a gist of the content by scanning post titles.

The index page should show the title and metadata of posts, maybe a short summary. That's it.
