# FuriousFPV Moskito 70 Undercarriage

#3D model
#drone

This model is the undercarriage for the [Furious FPV Moskito 70 drone](https://www.getfpv.com/furiousfpv-moskito-70-frsky.html).

I designed this because I got tired of taking ages to find the thing after a crash because the battery would get ejected, 
rendering the beeper useless. It uses the same mounting holes and screws as the stock covers.

The battery compartment is sized to fit 300mAh Turnigy Nano Tech batteries plus a little space for a Velcro pad between
the battery and the frame.


## Version 2

You obviously need two of these.
