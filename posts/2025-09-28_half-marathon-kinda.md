# I Ran A Half-Marathon This Week* 🏃

#excersise

...across 4 days, totalling 24 km, 139 minutes and burning over 2000 kcal.

I've always loved running since I was a kid and have been trying to build a habit of actually going out and doing it
rather than thinking 'I should' or making excuses to myself. It is well documented that exercise is good for you in all
kinds of ways, and I do feel a fundamental difference after having been running a couple of times. More confident, more
motivated, better sleep, and my energy levels are generally much higher.

I'd like to try to keep it up; I wrote this post partly as a self-reminder of why I should. I'd also like to build a
simple app which shows some stats from the runs to help try to motivate me to keep it up, sounds like a fun project too.
Perhaps a GitHub style calendar? I already have all the data in GPX format, and there are plenty off-the-shelf GPX
parsers.
