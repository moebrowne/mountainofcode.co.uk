# Don't Automate The Fun Parts

#automation

I love automation! If there is something that a computer or robot can do for me, I'm all for it, especially when it is
a time-consuming and/or unskilled task.

Dishwashers and washing machines are a great example of this, you trade a little electricity and water for your own
time. Time which can be spent doing something _much_ more valuable.

Like all things, this can go too far. While building this blog, I had the idea of automating the publishing of posts by
assigning them future dates. I caught myself, I realised that what I had done was automated the part I enjoy most about
blogging, hitting publish and sending a thing out into the world.
