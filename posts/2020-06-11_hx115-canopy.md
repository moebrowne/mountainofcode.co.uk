# Beta FPV HX115 Canopy

#3D model
#drone

This is one of my more 'creative' designs, it's a canopy for the [Beta FPV HX115](https://betafpv.com/products/hx115-hd-micro-race-drone).

It makes heavy use of `{openscad}hull()` to produce the faceted design. It needs holes drilling for the camera mount and
VTX antenna.
