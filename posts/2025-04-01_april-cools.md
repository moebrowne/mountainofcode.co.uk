# April Cools 🛹

#april cools

A couple of months ago I stumbled across [The April Cools Club](https://www.aprilcools.club/). In their own words:

> The idea is pretty simple: on April Fools' Day (also known as “April 1st”), a participant produces genuine content
> that's very different from their normal produced content. It could be a different format, a different topic, a 
> different style, anything.

I thought I'd give this a go. This blog is already just a mishmash of whatever I want to write about, but it's all very
tech oriented. Over the next month I want to challenge myself to write about different topics, anything goes, I expect
it will be meta-cognition or nature related 🌳

I'm not going to stop posting about tech, tech is my passion, it will be as well as. I'll probably keep posting tech
stuff like I normally do on Fridays. These new posts will be published as and when I have something to write rather than
on any kind of schedule.

To kick things off here are some cuttings I made just the other day. They are Swedish Ivy, a very easy and tolerant
plant. Once they have some fairly good roots they will be planted into pots. The test tube rack has been lying around
for ages looking for something useful to do, it's nice to see it get some use.
