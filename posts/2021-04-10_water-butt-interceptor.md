# Water Butt Downpipe Interceptor

#3D model

A rainwater downpipe interceptor which diverts into a water butt until it is full and then overflows into the drain. It
fits a standard 68 mm downpipe.

There are two parts for ease of printing, they snap together, but I recommend putting a couple of screws through them.
You could glue them together, but experience shows that you will need to open once in a while to clean it out.

There are many variables in the SCAD file which can be tweaked.
